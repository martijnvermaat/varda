def ensure(*conditions, **options):
    """
    Decorator to ensure some given conditions are met.

    The conditions arguments are functions returning ``True`` on success and
    ``False`` otherwise. By default, all conditions must be met. A custom
    scheme can be specified with the `satisfy` keyword argument, which must be
    a function consuming an iterable and returning a boolean. For example,
    ``satisfy=any`` uses the standard library function `any` to ensure that at
    least one of the conditions is met.

    When the condition scheme is not satisfied, the request is aborted with a
    401 status if there is no user authenticated or with a 403 status
    otherwise.

    .. todo::

        Add an `auth_helps` boolean argument defaulting to `True` that, if set
        to `False`, causes the request to be aborted with a 403 status
        regardless of the authentication state.

        This would be useful for conditions independent from authentication.

    Typical conditions may depend on the roles of an authorized user, for
    examples::

        >>> def is_admin():
        ...     return 'admin' in g.user.roles
        ...
        >>> @app.route('/samples', methods=['GET'])
        >>> @ensure(is_admin)
        >>> def list_variants():
        ...     return []

    To specify which keyword arguments to pass to the condition functions as
    positional and keyword arguments, use the `args` and `kwargs` keyword
    arguments, respectively.

    The `args` keyword argument lists the rule keyword arguments by name that
    should be passed as positional arguments to the condition functions, in
    that order. For example, to pass the `variant_id` argument::

        >>> def owns_variant(variant):
        ...     return True
        ...
        >>> @app.route('/samples/<sample_id>/variants/<variant_id>', methods=['GET'])
        >>> @ensure(owns_variant, args=['variant_id'])
        >>> def get_variant(sample_id, variant_id):
        ...     return 'variant'

    The `kwargs` keyword argument maps condition function keyword arguments to
    their respective rule keyword arguments. For example, to pass the
    `sample_id` and `variant_id` rule arguments as `sample` and `variant`
    keyword arguments to the condition functions::

        >>> def owns_sample_and_variant(variant=None, sample=None):
        ...     return True
        ...
        >>> @app.route('/samples/<sample_id>/variants/<variant_id>', methods=['GET'])
        >>> @ensure(owns_sample_and_variant, kwargs={'sample': 'sample_id', 'variant': 'variant_id'})
        >>> def get_variant(sample_id, variant_id):
        ...     return 'variant'

    By default, the condition functions are passed all rule keyword arguments.
    This makes it easy to use conditions that use the same names for keyword
    arguments as the decorated rule without the need for the `args` or
    `kwargs` arguments::

        >>> def owns_variant(variant_id, **_):
        ...     return True
        ...
        >>> @app.route('/samples/<sample_id>/variants/<variant_id>', methods=['GET'])
        >>> @ensure(owns_variant)
        >>> def get_variant(sample_id, variant_id):
        ...     return 'variant'

    Note that since all keyword arguments are passed here, the condition
    function has to accept all of them and not just the one it uses. The
    pattern ``**_`` as shown here captures any additional keyword arguments.
    If you want to explicitely not pass any keyword arguments, use
    ``kwargs={}``.

    Finally, an example with multiple conditions where at least one of them
    must be met::

        >>> @app.route('/samples/<sample_id>', methods=['GET'])
        >>> @ensure(is_admin, owns_sample, satisfy=any)
        >>> def get_samples(sample_id):
        ...     return 'variant'

    .. note:: The main limitation here is that only one argument scheme can be
        given, which is used for all condition functions. Therefore it is
        useful to have consistent argument naming in your condition functions.
