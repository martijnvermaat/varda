    Frequency information is annotated using fields in the INFO column. For
    the global frequency, we use the following fields:

    - ``GLOBAL_VN``: For each alternate allele, the number of individuals
      used for calculating ``GLOBAL_VF``, i.e. the number of individuals that
      have this region covered.
    - ``GLOBAL_VF``: For each alternate allele, the observed frequency, i.e.,
      the ratio of individuals in which the allele was observed.
    - ``GLOBAL_VF_HET``: For each alternate allele, the observed heterozygous
      frequency, i.e., the ratio of individuals in which the allele was
      observed heterozygous.
    - ``GLOBAL_VF_HOM``: For each alternate allele, the observed homozygous
      frequency, i.e., the ratio of individuals in which the allele was
      observed homozygous.

    Note that the ``GLOBAL_VF_HET`` and ``GLOBAL_VF_HOM`` values for a
    particular alternate allele might not add up to the ``GLOBAL_VF`` value,
    since there can be observations where the exact genotype is unknown.

    For the per-sample frequencies, we use the following fields, where the
    ``S1`` prefix identifies the sample:

    - ``S1_VN``: For each alternate allele, the number of individuals used for
      calculating ``S1_VF``, i.e., the number of individuals that have this
      region covered, or, if the sample does not have coverage information,
      simply the number of individuals contained in the sample.
    - ``S1_VF``: For each alternate allele, the observed frequency, i.e., the
      ratio of individuals in which the allele was observed.
    - ``S1_VF_HET``: For each alternate allele, the observed heterozygous
      frequency, i.e., the ratio of individuals in which the allele was
      observed heterozygous.
    - ``S1_VF_HOM``: For each alternate allele, the observed homozygous
      frequency, i.e., the ratio of individuals in which the allele was
      observed homozygous.

    Remember that in our model, `sample` is not the same as `individual`. A
    given sample might contain any number of individuals. For example, a
    population study such as 1KG can be modelled as one sample containing
    1092 individuals. As another example, to guarantee anonymity of clinical
    data, multiple individuals might be pooled into one sample.
